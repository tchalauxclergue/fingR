# Usage

To illustrate the usage of the fingR package, a database containing layers from a sediment core and potential sources samples was used. The 38 layers of a sediment core collected in the Mano Dam reservoir (Fukushima, Japan) in June 2021 were used as mixture targets. The potential source samples include four classes: undecontaminated cropland (*n* = 24), remediated cropland (*n* = 22), forest (*n* = 24), and subsoil (mainly granite saprolite; *n* = 24). All sediment and soil samples were sieved to 63 μm and analysed, the organic matter (total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN)) and elemental geochemistry by ED-XRF (Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti, Zn, Zr) were used as potential tracer properties.

This dataset, along with detailed measurement protocols, is available for download on Zenodo at [Chalaux-Clergue et al. (2024c)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7081093).

For more details about functions, please read function vignettes (RStudio 'Help' section - press F1 for a quick access).

## 1 - Data preparation

The first step is to load the database, in this guide it consists of a data file and a metadata file. To support database sharing and compatibility, a database template has been proposed and made available on Zenodo at [Chalaux-Clergue et al., (2024b) (ver. 24.03.01)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10725788).


```{r, echo = FALSE}
dir.example <- "temp_data/"
```

```{r}
# Load the fingR package
library(fingR)

# Get the directory to data and metadata files within the fingR package
data.dr <- system.file("extdata", "TCC_MDD_20210608_data_ChalauxClergue_et_al_v240319.csv", package = "fingR")
metadata.dr <- system.file("extdata", "TCC_MDD_20210608_metadata_ChalauxClergue_et_al_v240319.csv", package = "fingR")

# Load the csv files of data and metadata - replace the dir with your file direction
db.data <- read.csv(data.dr, sep = ";", fileEncoding = "latin1", na = "")
db.metadata <- read.csv(metadata.dr, sep = ";", fileEncoding = "latin1", na = "")
```


The different classes of potential sources and sediment samples information is in the `Class_decontamination column`. In which, the *Target* class refers to sediment core layers, and other classes to potential sediment sources.

```{r}
table(db.metadata$Class_decontamination)
```

### 1.1 - Data construction

A single dataset is built by joining the metadata (general information) and the data (analyses) sub-datasets. Both metadata and data `data.frames` are joined by common variables, here using the columns `IGSN` and `Sample_name`. In addition, two filters were applied. A filter to keep the analysed performed on the fraction ≤ 63 μm, and a filter to remove remediated cropland from the dataset, and therefore using three potential sources.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# Create a single dataset with metadata and data information
database <- dplyr::left_join(x = db.metadata,                      # Metadata data.frame
                             y = db.data,                          # Data data.frame
                             by = join_by(IGSN, Sample_name)) %>%  # In common variables
  dplyr::filter(Sample_size == "< 63 µm") %>%                      # Filter sample fraction
  dplyr::filter(Class_decontamination != "Remediated")             # Remove remediated cropland to keep 3 potential sources
```

Therefore, the final dataset contains three potential sources (i.e. forest, subsoil, and undecontaminated cropland).

```{r message = FALSE}
table(database$Class_decontamination)
```



### 1.2 - Selecting properties vectors

Among the analysed properties, a vector is created listing the column names of the values of the potential tracer properties, i.e. `prop.values`.

```{r}
# Display the database columns
# colnames(database)

# Select the column names of the properties values
prop.values <- database %>%                            # Database data.frame
  dplyr::select(TOC_PrC, TN_PrC,                       # Organic matter properties
                EDXRF_Al_mg.kg.1:EDXRF_Zr_mg.kg.1) %>% # Elemental geochemistry properties
  base::names()                                        # Extract column names
```
```{r}
prop.values
```

A vector of property measurement uncertainty column names is also created, `prop.uncertainties`. In order to maintain the relationship between the column names of the properties and the uncertainty, the column names of the properties are set as `names` of the vector of property names. This also simplifies the selection of the uncertainty column names, as they can be selected from the property column names.

```{r}
# Select the column names of the property measurement uncertainties values
prop.uncertainties <- database %>%               # Database data.frame
  dplyr::select(TOC_SD, TN_SD,                   # Organic matter properties
                EDXRF_Al_RMSE:EDXRF_Zr_RMSE) %>% # Elemental geochemistry uncertainties
  base::names()                                  # Extract column names

# Set property names to property uncertainty names for easier selection
base::names(prop.uncertainties) <- prop.values   # Set properties values as names for uncertainties
```
```{r}
unname(prop.uncertainties)
```

### 1.3 - Evaluation of measurement quality

The `data.watcher` function allows to check the format of the selected properties. The function verifies if the values of the property are all negative (e.g. δ<sup>13</sup>C, δ<sup>15</sup>N ), which will require an inversion of the value prior to Bayesian modelling where the data is systematically log-transformed, and if some samples have negative values, which will require manual verification or correction of the data. If the measurement uncertainties are provided to the `prop.uncer` argument, the function will indicate if the measurement uncertainty makes some values virtually impossible, and will give the maximum relative uncertainty if it is greater than 5 %. The result of this function should encourage the user to consider the quality of his data.

```{r}
fingR::data.watcher(data = database,                 # Database data.frame
                    properties = prop.values,        # Vector of property labels
                    prop.uncer = prop.uncertainties) # vector of measurement uncertainty labels
```

According to the `data.watcher` function, some samples have negative ED-XRF Cr values and the Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Rb appear to be high. These properties are removed from the properties used in the following guide.

```{r}
# Remove the properties listed from the vector of properties
prop.values <- prop.values[!prop.values %in% c("EDXRF_Co_mg.kg.1", "EDXRF_Cr_mg.kg.1", "EDXRF_Cu_mg.kg.1", "EDXRF_Ni_mg.kg.1", "EDXRF_Rb_mg.kg.1")]
```
```{r}
prop.values
```

As well the measurement uncertainties of these properties are removed from the selection.

```{r}
# Keep uncertainties associated to the new vector of properties
prop.uncertainties <- prop.uncertainties[prop.values]
```
```{r}
prop.uncertainties
```


## 2 - Tracer Selection

### 2.1 - Conservative behaviour

The three-step method assesses conservative behaviour using range tests (RT), also known as bracket tests. For a property to be considered conservative, the values of each target sample must fall within the range of potential source classes. This range is defined by the highest and lowest values in a given source class for a given criterion. The `range.test` function allows the calculation of the range test on each property according to multiple range test criteria.

Several range test criteria have been documented, including minimum-maximum (`MM`), minimum-maximum with a 10 % margin of error (`MMe`), boxplot whiskers (outlier exclusion threshold), boxplot hinges (representing the middle 50 %), mean, mean plus/minus one standard deviation (`mean.sd`), and median. For the mean and `mean.sd` criteria, log-transformed values are used, assuming a normal distribution. The function applies all criteria by default (`criteria = c("all")`), or the user can freely select several tests from the following list: `MM`, `MMe`, `whiskers`, `hinge`, `mean`, `mean.sd` and/or `median`. Their effectiveness in detecting conservative properties varies. Among them, the <ins>`mean.sd` criterion</ins> is mathematically the most robust.

The `range.test` function outputs a list with two data frames:

* `$results.df` : A summary overview of all properties range test outcomes.

* `$results.RT` : Detailed range test results for each target sample across properties, where `TRUE` indicates that the sample value is within the range, while `high` and `low` indicate values outside the
range.

Within the `range.test` function, the `class` argument specifies the column name containing the classifications for potential source and target mixture samples. The label for the target mixtures used in `class` should be provided in the `mixture` argument. The `sample.id` argument designates the column containing the unique identifiers or labels for each sample. When a saving directory path the results is provided to `save.dir`, the function write two CSV files: "RT_samples[_note].csv" corresponding to `results.RT`, and "Range_test[_note].csv" corresponding to `results.df`.

```{r}
rt.results <- fingR::range.tests(data = database,                 # Data.frame with source and mixture information
                                 class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                                 mixture = "Target",              # Labeling of mixtures in `class`
                                 properties = prop.values,        # Vector of property labels
                                 sample.id = "Sample_name",       # Identifier for individual samples
                                 criteria = c("mean.sd"),         # Range test critirion/criteria (options: "MM", "MMe", "whiskers", "hinge", "mean", "mean.sd", "median", or "all")
                                 # MM.error = c(0.1),             # Optional - Set min-max +/- error as a percentage (here 10 %)
                                 # save.dir = dir.example,        # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                 # note = "example"               # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                 )
```
```{r}
# Results of the mean.sd range test for all properties
rt.results$results.df
```

The result of the range test for some target samples and a property that did not pass the range test.

```{r}
rt.results$results.RT$EDXRF_Pb_mg.kg.1[1:5,]
```

Based on the `$results.df` data frame from `range.tests`, the `is.conservative` function filter the properties that passed the range tests for each criterion, and returns a list of vectors. Each vector contains the names of the properties that were identified as conservative according to each criterion.

```{r}
prop.cons <- fingR::is.conservative(data = rt.results$results.df, # Data.frame of the range test results (generated by fingR::range.tests())
                                    # property = "Property",      # Optional - Column with property labels
                                    # test.format = "RT",         # Optional - Common pattern in test column labels
                                    # position = 2,               # Optional - Position of test column labels in column names
                                    # separator = "_",            # Optional - Character to split test column labels
                                    # note = "example"            # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                    )
```
```{r}
prop.cons
```


### 2.2 - Discriminant power

The three-step method evaluates the ability of the traits to discriminate between source groups using a statistical test to test whether or not samples are from the same distribution. Conventionally, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H test (KW) is used. The KW test is an extension of the two-sample Mann-Whitney U test. As an alternative to the KW test, the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test could be used. The KS test allows for a more detailed understanding of the discrimination between pairs of source groups. For instance, the KS tests for for three source groups will be structured as: source A vs. source B, source A vs. source C, and source B vs source C. The `discriminant.test` function allows the calculation of the discriminant power of each property. By setting the using the test argument to `KW` or `KS` , the Kruskal-Wallis H-test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is carried out.

When using the KS test (`test = "KW"`), the significance of the test *p* value is commonly set to 5 % (`p.level = 0.05`). Whilst, when using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ( test = "KS" ), which is highly sensitive to distribution differences, the significance of the test *p* value could be set to lower value, for instance, 1 % (`p.level = 0.01`).

Two CSV files will be written if the path to the save directory is given to the `save.dir` argument:

* ’Discriminant_pairs[_note].csv’, generated if `save.discrim.tests = TRUE` (default), contains the *p* value of each two-samples KS tests for each property. Set `return.tests = TRUE` to return this table as `$result.KS` (default is `FALSE`).

> [!WARNING]
> When using the KW test, the KS test results can also help verify the KW assumption of similar distribution shape across groups.

* ’Discriminant_tests[_note].csv’ summarises the results from KS or KW tests.

  * For `test = "KW"`, the number of groups that follows a similar distribution shape(`n.similar.groups`) is reported. If this value matches the total number of source groups, the the assumption of similar distribution shapes is satisfied (`respect.KW.shape.assumption`). The table also includes the *p* value (`KW_p.value`) and its significance (`KW_signif`) for each properties.
  
  * For `test = "KS"`, the number of statistically different groups (`n.diff.groups`) is reported, and if it is at least equal to the threshold (`min.discriminant = 1`) required to identify a property as discriminant, the property is marked as discriminant in `KS_discriminant`.
  
Example for KW test:

```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
KW.results <- fingR::discriminant.test(data = database,                 # Data.frame with source and mixture information
                                       class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                                       mixture = "Target",              # Labeling of mixtures in `class`
                                       test = "KW",                     # Performed test: Kruskal-Wallis (KW) or Kolmogorov-Smornov (KS)
                                       properties = prop.values,        # Vector of property labels
                                       p.level = .05,                   # Optional - significance level value (i.e. p value)
                                       # save.discrim.tests = TRUE,     # Optional - If source couple tests should be saved
                                       # save.dir = dir.example,        # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                       # note = "example",              # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                       return.tests = TRUE              # Optional - If source couple tests should be return
                                       )
```
```{r}
KW.results$result.KS[1:3,]
```

```{r}
KW.results$results.df[1:5,]
```


Example for KS test:

```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
KS.results <- fingR::discriminant.test(data = database,                 # Data.frame with source and mixture information
                                       class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                                       mixture = "Target",              # Labeling of mixtures in `class`
                                       test = "KS",                     # Performed test: Kruskal-Wallis (KW) or Kolmogorov-Smornov (KS)
                                       properties = prop.values,        # Vector of property labels
                                       p.level = .01,                   # Optional - significance level value (i.e. p value)
                                       min.discriminant = 1,            # Optional - KS only. Minimum number of significantly different source couples
                                       save.discrim.tests = TRUE,       # Optional - If source couple tests should be saved
                                       # save.dir = dir.example,        # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                       # note = "example",              # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                       return.tests = TRUE              # Optional - If source couple tests should be return
                                       )
```
```{r}
KS.results$result.KS[1:3,]
```

```{r}
KS.results$results.df[1:5,]
```

The results from the KS test are used for the following guide.


Based on the `$results.df` data frame from `discriminant.test`, the `is.discriminant` function filter out the properties that passed the discriminant power tests according to the set p value (`p.level`) as list them in a vector. The function recognise the structure of the data frame produced by the `discriminant.test` function, however, it is possible to set it for other data frame format by setting its arguments.

prop.discrim <- fingR::is.discriminant(KS.results$results.df,                    # data.frame with the information regarding discriminant power (TRUE/FALSE)
                                       ## Folowing arguments are needed if the discrimant power test is not performed with `fingR::discriminant.test`

                                       # note = "example"                        # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                       )
```
```{r is.discriminant results}
prop.discrim
```

### 2.3 - Identified tracers: conservative and discriminant properties

The properties that pass both the evaluation of conservative behaviour (`prop.cons` from `is.conservative`) and discriminant power (`prop.discrim` from `is.discriminant`) are compared by the `selected.tracers` function, which list them in a vector.

```{r}
tracers <- fingR::is.tracers(cons = prop.cons,        # List of properties considered as conservative
                             discrim = prop.discrim)  # List of properties considered as discriminant
```
```{r}
tracers 
```

### 2.4 - Discriminat Function Analysis stepwise selection

Frequently, a Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) stepwise selection is applyed on the selected tracers. The DFA stepwise selection aims to retain the tracers that maximise source discrimination. Of note, the DFA stepwise selection has been criticised since its use is associated to a reduction of the number of tracers, especially since some studies showed that the use of a higher number of tracers decreases the sensitivity of sediment source fingerprinting modelling to non-conservative tracers ([Martínez-Carreras et al., 2008](https://iahs.info/uploads/dms/14500.16-94-105-11-325-Martinez.pdf); [Sherriff et al., 2015](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11368-015-1123-5)). In addition, it is not useful for small selection of tracers, as it is the case here.

The `stepwise.selection` function allows to apply a forward stepwise selection based on the tracer selected, and returns a vector containing the retained tracers.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tracers.SW <- fingR::stepwise.selection(data = database,                 # Data.frame with source and mixture information
                                        class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                                        tracers = tracers$mean.sd_KS,    # Vector of selected tracers
                                        target = "Target",               # Labeling of mixtures in `class`
                                        # save.dir = dir.example,        # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                        # note = "example"               # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                        )
```
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tracers.SW
```

Here, the stepwise selection did not remove any of the selected tracers. However, if the stepwise selection resulted in different tracers, examining the modelling results for both sets may provide useful insights. Both
tracer selection vectors could be joint in a list as follows:

```{r all.tracers}
all.tracers <- list("mean.sd_KS" = tracers$mean.sd_KS, # Vector of selected tracers
                    "mean.sd_KS_DFA" = tracers.SW)     # Vector of selected tracers after the DFA stepwise selection
```
```{r all.tracers print}
all.tracers
```


## 3 - Source Contribution Modelling

### 3.1 - Virtual Mixtures Generation

To evaluate the accuracy of unmixing models, virtual mixtures could be used as a reliable alternative to laboratory mixtures ([Batista et al., 2022](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11368-022-03157-4)). These artificial mixtures (virtual or laboratory made) act as target samples with known contributions, enabling for the calculation of modelling accuracy metrics. In addition, the ease of virtual mixture generation allows to explore a wide range of source contribution combinations.

The `VM.contrib.generator` function allows a combination of source contributions to be generated. The contributions are designed to range from a minimum value (`min`) to a maximum value (`max`) by a specified step (`step`). The function first creates a contribution sequence for the first group of sources, from `min` to `max` according to the `step` (e.g. `min = 0`, `max = 100`, `step = 5`: 0, 5, 10, ... 100). The following sources are then defined as the remaining maximum after the specified step. The contributions can be generated as a percentage (e.g. `min = 0` and `max= 100`) or as a ratio (e.g. `min = 0` and `max= 1`). A small increment results in a higher number of virtual mixtures. For example, three sources with 5 % increment (`min = 0`, `max = 100`, `step = 5`) generated 231 contribution combinations, and 5151 contribution combinations with 1 % increment (`step = 1`).

The contribution combination data frame is saved (’VM_contributions[_note][number of virtual mixtures].csv’) in the save directory specified by the `save.dir` argument.

```{r}
# Generate virtual mixture source contributions
VM.contrib <- fingR::VM.contrib.generator(n.sources = 3,                                              # Number of sources groups
                                          min = 0,                                                    # Minimum contribution value
                                          max = 100,                                                  # Maximum contribution value (here in %)
                                          step = 5,                                                   # Step between two contribution levels (here in %)
                                          sources.class = c("Forest", "Subsoil", "Undecontaminated"), # Optional - Label for source groups
                                          VM.name = "Sample_name",                                    # Optional - Virtual mixtures id column name 
                                          save.dir = dir.example,                                     # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                          # note = "example",                                         # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                          # return = TRUE,                                            # Optional - To return VM data frames
                                          # save = TRUE,                                              # Optional - To save VM data frames
                                          # fileEncoding = "latin1",                                  # Optional - Encoding format used to save data
                                          )
```
```{r}
VM.contrib[1:5,]
```

The property values for each virtual mixture are generated based on the source group property signatures (i.e. mean values). The property values are calculated as a simple mass balance, the mean value of each source group is multiplied by the theoretical contribution of each source group and the result is summed, as detailed in the following equation:

<p align="center">
$p = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{Si}~*~C_{Si}$
</p>

Where $p$ is the property value of a virtual mixture, $P_{Si}$ the mean value of the property for the source group $i$, $C_{Si}$ the theoretical contribution of the source group $i$ of the virtual mixture, and $n$ the number of source groups.

The `VM.builder` function allows the calculation of the tracers values (`tracers`) of the virtual mixtures generated with `VM.contrib.generator` according to their respective theoretical source contribution combinations (`contributions`). The `VM.builder` function returns and, if `save.dir` is set, saves three data frames:

* `$property` - ’VM_properties[_note].csv’: contains the values of the tracers for each virtual mixtures.

* `$uncertainty` - ’VM_properties_SD[_note].csv’: contains the uncertainty of the tracers. If the actual measurement uncertainty are provided (`uncertainty`) they will be used, otherwise 5 % of the tracer values will be considered as measurement uncertainty.

* `$full` - ’VM_properties_full[_note].csv’: contains the values of the tracers and their measurement uncertainty.

It is possible to add the property values data frame of the source samples to the one of the virtual mixture by setting `add.sources = TRUE`, which could be required when running unmixing models.


```{r message = FALSE}
VM <- fingR::VM.builder(data = database,                 # Data.frame with source and mixture information
                        material = "Material",           # Column with classification betwen source and target
                        source.name = "Source",          # Labeling of source samples in `material`
                        class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                        tracers = tracers$mean.sd_KS,    # Vector of tracers
                        uncertainty = unname(prop.uncertainties[tracers$mean.sd_KS]), # Vector of tracer uncertainties - note: easy selection of uncertainty labels
                        contributions = VM.contrib,      # Virtual mixtures contributions
                        VM.name = "Sample_name",         # Virtual mixtures id column name
                        add.sources = TRUE,              # Add source information at the end of the VM data frames
                        save.dir = dir.example,          # Optional - Directory path to save results
                        # note = "example"               # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                        )
```

```{r message = FALSE}
VM$full[1:5,]
```

It is also possible to generate virtual mixture contributions and tracer values in one step in the `VM.builder` function, by setting the contribution range as a vector (`VM.range`) and the step (`VM.step`), such as below:

```{r message = FALSE}
VM <- fingR::VM.builder(data = database,                 # Data.frame with source and mixture information
                        material = "Material",           # Column with classification betwen source and target
                        source.name = "Source",          # Labeling of source samples in `material`
                        class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                        tracers = tracers$mean.sd_KS,    # Vector of tracers
                        uncertainty = unname(prop.uncertainties[tracers$mean.sd_KS]), # Vector of tracer uncertainties - note: easy selection of uncertainty labels
                        VM.range = c(0, 100),            # Optional - Range of VM contributions
                        VM.step = 5,                     # Optional - Step between two contribution levels
                        VM.name = "Sample_name",         # Virtual mixtures id column name
                        add.sources = TRUE,              # Add source information at the end of the VM data frames
                        save.dir = dir.example,          # Optional - Directory path to save results
                        note = "VM"                      # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                        )
```
```{r message = FALSE}
VM$full[1:5,]
```

### 3.2 - Un-mixing models

Running the models will generate numerous files, therefore we recommended to create a dedicated folder to organise them, and keep the directory with `dir.modelling`.

```{r}
dir.create(file.path(dir.example, "Modelling/"), showWarnings = FALSE) # Create a folder
dir.modelling <- paste0(dir.example, "Modelling/")                     # Keep folder path
```



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.2.1 - Bayesian Mean Model (BMM)

Similarly, create a dedicated folder for Bayesian Mean modelling (BMM), and keep the directory with `dir.mod.BMM.`

```{r}
dir.create(file.path(dir.modelling, "BMM/"), showWarnings = FALSE) # Create a folder
dir.mod.BMM <- paste0(dir.modelling, "BMM/")                       # Keep folder path
```

The Bayesian Mean Model (BMM) is a statistical approach that uses Bayesian inference to estimate the mean of a population or dataset ([Laceby and Olley, 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.10287); [Batista et al., 2019](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11368-018-2199-5)). This approach incorporates prior knowledge and observed data to calculate a posterior distribution for the mean, providing a probabilistic framework that accounts for uncertainty in the estimates. The BMM approach that minimises the sum of square residuals of the mixing equation for each iteration of a Monte Carlo simulation.


### 3.2.1.a - Run BMM

The `run.BMM` function has been developed to allow to simplify the use of the BMM model. The number of iterations should be set in `n.iter`, between 2500 and 7500, to ensure convergence of the Monte Carlo chain.

The function returns a data frame containing the individual iteration source contributions for each mixture and, if `save.dir` is set, saves it as ’BMM_prevision[_note].csv


> [!TIP]
> Setting `n.iter` to 30 allows the structure to be tested before the actual modelling is carried out.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not compulsory to provide the actual measurement uncertainty of tracers to `uncertainty` argument, although, it is highly recommended.

```{r run BMM, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

BMM.mix <- fingR::run.BMM(data = database,                 # Data.frame with source and mixture information
                          class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                          mixture = "Target",              # Labeling of mixtures in `class`
                          sample.id = "Sample_name",       # Identifier for individual samples
                          tracers = tracers$mean.sd_KS,    # Vector of tracers
                          uncertainty = unname(prop.uncertainties[tracers$mean.sd_KS]), # Vector of tracer uncertainties
                          n.iter = 30,                     # Number of iteration - TEST VERSION
                          save.dir = dir.mod.BMM,          # Optional - Directory path to save results
                          # note = "example"               # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                          )
```


When dealing with isotopic ratios, which are non-linear properties, the residuals of the mixing equation for each iteration should be calculated taking into account the relative content of the related property (see [Laceby and Olley (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.10287) for further explanation). Several isotopic ratios could be used, bearing in mind that the order must be identical between `isotope.ratio`, isotope.prop and `isotopes.unc`. For example, when using the δ<sup>13</sup>C isotopic ratio in organic matter, the run.BMM function should be set as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> `isotope.ratio`, `isotope.prop`, and `isotopes.unc` work for any type of non linear properties.


```{r run BMM iso, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

BMM.mix.iso <- fingR::run.BMM(data = database,                 # Data.frame with source and mixture information
                              class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                              mixture = "Target",              # Labeling of mixtures in `class`
                              sample.id = "Sample_name",       # Identifier for individual samples
                              tracers = tracers$mean.sd_KS,    # Vector of tracers
                              uncertainty = unname(prop.uncertainties[tracers$mean.sd_KS]), # Vector of tracer uncertainties
                              isotope.ratio = c("d13C_PrM"),   # Optional: Character vector containing isotopic ratios
                              isotope.prop = c("TOC_PrC"),     # Optional: Character vector containing isotopic ratios respective properties
                              isotopes.unc = c("d13C_SD"),     # Optional: Character vecotr containing uncertainty of the isotopic ratios
                              n.iter = 30,                     # Number of iteration - TEST VERSION
                              save.dir = dir.mod.BMM,          # Optional - Directory path to save results
                              # note = "example"               # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                              )
```



### 3.2.1.b - Collect and organise BMM contributions

Then, the predictions resulting from the BMM must be processed to determine the contribution values for each target mixture.


The `BMM.summary` function provides a summary of the predictions, including mean value, standard deviation, and various quantiles (2.5, 5, 25, 50, 75, 95, 97.5) for each target mixture (saves ’BMM_contrib[_note].csv’). From this summary, the `BMM.pred` function extracts the median and/or mean, `stats = "Median"`, `stats = "Mean"`, or `stats = c("Median", "Mean")`, value of source contributions for each target mixture (saves ’BMM_ordered_contrib[_note].csv’). Finally, the `ensure.total` function ensures that the total of the predicted source contributions from all sources sum to 1 or 100 % (saves ’corrected_contrib[_note].csv’).

```{r}
# Summarise BMM model previsions
BMM.summary.mix <- fingR::BMM.summary(pred = BMM.mix,            # Data.frame with the predicted contributions from BMM
                                      # sample.id = "mix.names", # Column name for individual sample id
                                      # source = "source",       # Column name for source information
                                      # value = "value",         # Column name for individual sample predictions
                                      save.dir = dir.mod.BMM,    # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                      # note = "example"         # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                      )
```
```{r}
BMM.summary.mix[1:5,]
```

```{r}
# Extracts the median value of the previsions
BMM.preds.mix <- fingR::BMM.pred(data = BMM.summary.mix,         # Data.frame with the summary statistics of BMM predicted contribution (usually from `fingR::BMM.summary.mix`)
                                 stats = "Median",               # Summary statistics for source contribution ("Mean" or "Median")
                                 # sample.id = "mix.names",      # Column name for individual sample id
                                 # source = "source",            # Column name for source information
                                 save.dir = dir.mod.BMM,         # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                 # note = "example"              # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                 )
```
```{r}
BMM.preds.mix[1:5,]
```

```{r}
# Ensure that the total predicted contribution sums to 1 or to 100%
BMM.preds.mixE <- fingR::ensure.total(data = BMM.preds.mix,      # Data.frame with each sample predicted source contribution (usually from `fingR::BMM.pred`)
                                      sample.id = "mix.names",   # Column name for individual sample id
                                      save.dir = dir.mod.BMM,    # Optional - Directory path to save results

```
```{r}
BMM.preds.mixE[1:5,]
```

The same sequence of functions is applied for the virtual mixture predictions, resulting in `BMM.summary.VM` from `BMM.summary`, `BMM.preds.VM` from `BMM.pred`, and `BMM.pred.VME` from `ensure.total`.

```{r run BMM VM, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

                         mixture = "Virtual Mixture",     # Labeling of mixtures in `class`
                         sample.id = "Sample_name",       # Identifier for individual samples

### 3.2.2 - MixSIAR model

Create a dedicated folder for MixSIAR modelling, and keep the directory with `dir.mod.MixSIAR`.

```{r}
dir.create(file.path(dir.modelling, "MixSIAR/"), showWarnings = FALSE) # Create a folder
dir.mod.MixSIAR <- paste0(dir.modelling, "MixSIAR/")                   # Keep folder path
```

The MixSIAR package is designed to create and run Bayesian mixing models using Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS). This package is widely used in the sediment source fingerprinting community to predict source contribution. To explore more about MixSIAR, including detailed tutorials, examples, and technical documentation, please visit the official MixSIAR website. Additionally, the source code and further resources can be found on the MixSIAR GitHub page ([https://github.com/brianstock/MixSIAR/tree/3.1.9](https://github.com/brianstock/MixSIAR/tree/3.1.9)).

According to MixSIAR guide, installation should follow these steps:

  * Download and install/update R ([https://cran.r-project.org/bin/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/)).

  * Download and install JAGS ([https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/)).

  * Open R and run:
  
```{r install MixSIAR, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install.packages("MixSIAR", dependencies = TRUE)
```

  Or install the GitHub version:

```{r install MixSIAR GitHub, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages(remotes)
remotes::install_github("brianstock/MixSIAR", dependencies = TRUE)
```

  * Load the `MixSIAR` package:

```{r load MixSIAR}
library(MixSIAR)
```


### 3.2.2.a - Generate data for MixSIAR

To MixSIAR model requires data to be formated in a specific format to load the information of source and mixture samples. The `data.for.MixSIAR` function generates CSV files that conform to the format required by MixSIAR loading functions (i.e. `load_mix_data` , `load_source_data` , and `load_discr_data` ). The function generates three files with the properties according to the specified tracer selection (in `tracers` argument):

* ’MixSIAR_mix[_note].csv’: containing mixtures information.

* ’MixSIAR_sources[_note].csv’: containing the mean and standard deviation (sd) of the source classes.

* ’MixSIAR_discrimination[_note].csv’: containing is a matrix of zero as there is no trophic information in sediment source fingerprinting studies.

```{r}
# Actual sediment samples
MixSIAR.dt <- fingR::data.for.MixSIAR(data = database,                 # Data.frame with source and mixture information
                                      class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                                      target = "Target",               # Labeling of mixtures in `class`
                                      tracers = tracers$mean.sd_KS,    # Vector of tracers
                                      sample.id = "Sample_name",       # Column name for individual sample
                                      save.dir = dir.mod.MixSIAR,      # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                      # note = "exemple",              # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                      # fileEncoding = "latin1",       # Optional - Encoding format used to save data
                                      show.data = TRUE,                # Optional - To show created data.frame
                                      )
```

```{r}
MixSIAR.dt$sources
```

```{r}
MixSIAR.dt$mix[1:5,]
```

```{r}
MixSIAR.dt$discimination
```

The same function is run for the virtual mixtures.

```{r}
# Virtual Mixtures
fingR::data.for.MixSIAR(data = VM$full,                  # Data.frame with source and virtual mixture information
                        class = "Class_decontamination", # Column with classification or grouping or sources and mixtures
                        target = "Virtual Mixture",      # Labeling of mixtures in `class`
                        tracers = tracers$mean.sd_KS,    # Vector of tracers
                        sample.id = "Sample_name",       # Column name for individual sample
                        save.dir = dir.mod.MixSIAR,      # Optional - Directory path to save results
                        note = "VM",                     # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                        # fileEncoding = "latin1",       # Optional - Encoding format used to save data
                        show.data = FALSE,                # Optional - To show created data.frame
                        )
```


### 3.2.2.b - Load mixture, source and discrimination data

The MixSIAR functions `load_mix_data`, `load_source_data`, and `load_discr_data` are used to load the corresponding CSV files for the actual mixtures: ’MixSIAR_mix.csv’ (actual mixtures), ’MixSIAR_sources.csv’ (sources), and ’MixSIAR_discrimination.csv’ (discrimination matrix) that were generated previously.

```{r Load data for MixSIAR}
# Load sediment samples data
MixSIAR.mix <- MixSIAR::load_mix_data(filename = paste0(dir.mod.MixSIAR, "MixSIAR_mix.csv"),                # CSV file with mixture data
                                      iso_names = tracers$mean.sd_KS,                                       # Vector of tracers
                                      factors = c("Sample_name"),                                           # Column name for individual sample
                                      fac_random = FALSE,                                                   # Indicates if `factors` are a random effect
                                      cont_effects = NULL                                                   # Specify the column with continuous effect (here none)
                                      )

# Load source data
MixSIAR.source <- MixSIAR::load_source_data(filename = paste0(dir.mod.MixSIAR, "MixSIAR_sources.csv"),      # CSV file with source data
                                            source_factors = NULL,                                          # No source factors specified
                                            conc_dep = FALSE,                                               # Consideration of concentration
                                            data_type = "means",                                            # Type of source group values (here means)
                                            mix = MixSIAR.mix                                               # `load_mix_data` generated object
                                            )

# Load discrimination data
MixSIAR.discr <- MixSIAR::load_discr_data(filename = paste0(dir.mod.MixSIAR, "MixSIAR_discrimination.csv"), # CSv file with discrimination data
                                          mix = MixSIAR.mix                                                 # `load_mix_data` generated object
                                          )

```

The same functions are used to load the virtual mixtures information. The virtual mixtures properties (’MixSIAR_mix_VM.csv’) are loaded using `load_mix_data` and the same source and discrimination matrix files as for the actual mixtures.

```{r Load VM data for MixSIAR}
# Load virtual mixtures data
MixSIAR.VM <- MixSIAR::load_mix_data(filename = paste0(dir.mod.MixSIAR, "MixSIAR_mix_VM.csv"),                    # CSV file with mixture data
                                     iso_names = tracers$mean.sd_KS,                                              # Vector of tracers
                                     factors = c("Sample_name"),                                                  # Column name for individual sample
                                     fac_random = FALSE,                                                          # Indicates if `factors` are a random effect
                                     cont_effects = NULL                                                          # Specify the column with continuous effect (here none)
                                     )


# Load source data
MixSIAR.source.VM <- MixSIAR::load_source_data(filename = paste0(dir.mod.MixSIAR, "MixSIAR_sources_VM.csv"),      # CSV file with source data
                                               source_factors = NULL,                                             # No source factors specified
                                               conc_dep = FALSE,                                                  # Consideration of concentration
                                               data_type = "means",                                               # Type of source group values (here means)
                                               mix = MixSIAR.VM                                                   # `load_mix_data` generated object
                                               )

# Load discrimination data
MixSIAR.discr.VM <- MixSIAR::load_discr_data(filename = paste0(dir.mod.MixSIAR, "MixSIAR_discrimination_VM.csv"), # CSv file with discrimination data
                                             mix = MixSIAR.mix                                                    # `load_mix_data` generated object
                                             )

```

### 3.2.2.c - Write JAGS model file

The "JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler. It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation not wholly" used in MixSIAR package ([Stock et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1209993)). The `write_JAGS_model` writes the JAGS file to define the structure of the Bayesian model. The JAGS model is saved at the path set in `filename` and using the specified txt file name (e.g. ’MixSIAR_model.txt’).

```{r}
# Write JAGS model file for actual samples
MixSIAR::write_JAGS_model(filename = paste0(dir.mod.MixSIAR, "MixSIAR_model.txt"), # JAGS model file path and name
                          resid_err = FALSE,                                       # Whether to include residual error
                          process_err = TRUE,                                      # Whether to include process error
                          mix = MixSIAR.mix,                                       # Mixtures loaded dataset (from MixSIAR::load_mix_data)
                          source = MixSIAR.source)                                 # Sources loaded dataset (from MixSIAR::load_source_data)
```

Another JAGS model is written for virtual mixtures since the the mixture samples and sources are set in `mix` and `source`.

```{r}
# Write JAGS model file for virtual mixtures
MixSIAR::write_JAGS_model(filename = paste0(dir.mod.MixSIAR, "MixSIAR_model_VM.txt"), # JAGS model file path and name
                          resid_err = FALSE,                                          # Whether to include residual error
                          process_err = TRUE,                                         # Whether to include process error
                          mix = MixSIAR.VM,                                           # Mixtures loaded dataset (from MixSIAR::load_mix_data)
                          source = MixSIAR.source.VM)                                 # Sources loaded dataset (from MixSIAR::load_source_data)
```


### 3.2.2.d - Run MixSIAR

When running MixSIAR model you must choose one of the [MCMC run option](https://brianstock.github.io/MixSIAR/articles/wolves_ex.html#run-model) [(Stock et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1209993)

<p align="center">
| run ==       | Chain Length | Burn-in   | Thin | # Chains |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------- | ---- | -------- |  
| "test"       | 1,000        | 500       | 1    | 3        |
| "very short" | 10,000       | 5,000     | 5    | 3        |
| "short"      | 50,000       | 25,000    | 25   | 3        |
| "normal"     | 100,000      | 50,000    | 50   | 3        |
| "long"       | 300,000      | 200,000   | 100  | 3        |
| "very long"  | 1,000,000    | 500,000   | 500  | 3        |
| "extreme"    | 3,000,000    | 1,500,000 | 500  | 3        |
</p>

In this example MCMC is set to "test", which allows to quickly ensures that the code implemented is functional.

### 3.2.2.e - Collect and organise MixSIAR contributions

Similar to the BMM modelling, the predictions from the MixSIAR must be processed to determine the contribution values for each target mixture.

Conversely to `fingR::run.BMM` function, the `MixSIAR::run_model` function does not save the Bayesian previsions directly. Therefore the `JAGS.summary` function saves the previsions (’JAGS_prevision[_note].csv’) and provides a summary of the predictions, including mean value, standard deviation, and various quantiles (2.5, 5, 25, 50, 75, 95, 97.5) for each target mixture (saves ’JAGS_contrib[_note].csv’). From this summary, the `JAGS.pred` function extracts the median and/or mean, `stats = "Median"`, `stats = "Mean"`, or `stats = c("Median", "Mean")`, value of source contributions for each target mixture (saves ’JAGS_ordered_contrib[_note].csv’). Finally, the ensure.total function ensures that the total of the predicted source contributions from all sources sum to 1 or 100 % (saves ’corrected_contrib[_note].csv’).

```{r MixSIAR results}
## Summarise MixSIAR model previsions
MixSIAR.summary.mix <- fingR::JAGS.summary(jags.1 = jags.mix,          # Results from MixSIAR::run_model
                                           mix = MixSIAR.mix,          # Mixtures loaded dataset (from MixSIAR::load_mix_data)
                                           sources = MixSIAR.source,   # Sources loaded dataset (from MixSIAR::load_source_data)
                                           save.dir = dir.mod.MixSIAR, # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                           save.pred = TRUE            # To also save Monte Carlo predictions
                                           )

## Extracts the median value of the previsions
MixSIAR.preds.mix <- fingR::JAGS.pred(path = paste0(dir.mod.MixSIAR, "JAGS_contrib.csv"), # Directory path to `fingR::JAGS.summary` saved file
                                      stats = "Median",                # Summary statistics (`Median` or `Mean`)
                                      save = TRUE,                     # To save results
                                      # note = "example"               # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                      )

## Ensure that the total predicted contribution sums to 1 or 100%
MixSIAR.preds.mixE <- fingR::ensure.total(data = MixSIAR.preds.mix,    # data.frame with Bayensian model predictions (usually from `fingR::JAGS.pred`)
                                          sample.id = "sample",        # Identifier for individual samples
                                          save.dir = dir.mod.MixSIAR,  # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                          # note = "example            # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                          )
```
```{r MixSIAR results display}
MixSIAR.preds.mixE[1:5,]
```

The same sequence of functions is used for the virtual mixture predictions, resulting in `MixSIAR.summary.VM` from `JAGS.summary`, `MixSIAR.preds.VM` from `JAGS.pred`, and `MixSIAR.pred.VME` from `ensure.total`.

### 3.3 - Modelling accuracy statistics calculation

The accuracy of unmixing models is evaluated by comparing the theoretical source contribution values (`VM.contrib`), representing the known contributions of the virtual mixtures, with the predicted contributions of the virtual mixtures (`BMM.preds.VM`) generated by the unmixing model.

Several criteria can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions:

* **Uncertainty**: Assessed using prediction interval widths (e.g., W50, W95; for Bayesian models).

* **Residual Error** or **Bias**: Evaluated using metrics such as mean error (ME).

* **Performance**: Measured using metrics such as the squared Pearson correlation coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>), root-mean-square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency coefficient (NSE), and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS; for Bayesian models).

Modelling accuracy statistics could be interpreted the following way ([Chalaux-Clergue et al., 2024a](https://soil.copernicus.org/articles/10/109/2024/)): "Higher values of W50 indicate a wider distribution, which is related to a higher uncertainty. The sign of the ME indicates the direction of the bias, i.e. an overestimation or underestimation (positive or negative value, respectively). As ME is affected by cancellation, a ME of zero can also reflect a balanced distribution of predictions around the 1:1 line. Although this is not a bias, it does not mean that the model outputs are devoid of errors. The RMSE is a measure of the accuracy and allows us to calculate prediction errors of different models for a particular dataset. RMSE is always positive, and its ideal value is zero, which indicates a perfect fit to the data. As RMSE depends on the squared error, it is sensitive to outliers. The r<sup>2</sup> describes how linear the prediction is. The NSE indicates the magnitude of variance explained by the model, i.e. how well the predictions match with the observations. A negative RMSE indicates that the mean of the measured values provides a better predictor than the model. The joint use of r<sup>2</sup> and NSE allows for a better appreciation of the distribution shape of predictions and thus facilitates the understanding of the nature of model prediction errors. The CRPS evaluates both the accuracy and sharpness (i.e. precision) of a distribution of predicted continuous values from a probabilistic model for each sample ([Matheson and Winkler, 1976](http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.22.10.1087)). The CRPS is minimised when the observed value corresponds to a high probability value in the distribution of model outputs."

To illustrate, only predictions made using BMM are used, however, it also applies to predictions made using MixSIAR.


### 3.3.1 - General accuracy metrics

The `eval.groups` function calculates general accuracy metrics (ME, RMSE, r<sup>2</sup>, NSE) by comparing the theoretical source contribution values (provided in `df.obs`) with the predicted values (provided in `df.pred`) (saves ’stats[_note].csv’). In df.obs , the virtual mixtures are identified by the column Sample_name , while in `df.pred`, they are identified by the column `mix.names`, which is specified in `by` (The resulting data frame is saved as ’ObsPred[_note].csv’).

```{r Eval groups BMM}
BMM.stats <- fingR::eval.groups(df.obs = VM.contrib,                 # data.frame of theoretical contribution
                                df.pred = BMM.pred.VME %>%           # data.frame of predicted contribution
                                  dplyr::select(-total),             ## remove the $total column from ensured data.frame
                                by = c("Sample_name" = "mix.names"), # Variable to join df.obs and df.pred
                                save.dir = dir.mod.BMM,              # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                #note = "example"                    # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                )
```
```{r Eval groups BMM display}
BMM.stats
```

### 3.3.2 - Continuous ranked probability score

The `CRPS` function calculates the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). The predicted values of the virtual mixture (`prev`) are the previsions for each sample from the Bayesian models. Since a large number of previsions are made when running the Bayesian models, it is possible to specify the path to the file containing the previsions rather than loading them into the workspace in `path.to.prev` (previously saved by `BMM.summary`)

The function returns and, if `save.path` is set, saves two data frames at the `save.dir` direction or if `save = TRUE` is set, saves them at the direction indicated by `path.to.prev`:

* `$samples` - ’CRPS[_note].csv’: contains the CRPS values for each source group for each virtual mixtures.

* `$mean` - ’CRPS[_note]_mean.csv’: contains the values of the mean CRPS value per contribution source class group for each virtual mixtures.

```{r CRPS BMM}
# Calculate prediction CRPS values
BMM.CRPS <- fingR::CRPS(obs = VM.contrib,                                             # data.frame of theoretical contribution
                        prev = read.csv(paste0(dir.mod.BMM, "BMM_prevision_VM.csv")), # data.frame of Monte-Carlo simulation prevision (usually from fingR::JAGS.summary)
                        source.groups = c("Forest", "Subsoil", "Undecontaminated"),   # vector of source group labels
                        mean.cal = TRUE,                                              # Calculate the group mean CRPS (default FALSE)
                        save.dir = dir.mod.BMM,                                       # Optional - Directory path to save results
                        # note = "example"                                            # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                        )
```
```{r}
BMM.CRPS$samples[1:5,]
```

```{r}
BMM.CRPS$mean
```


### 3.3.3 - Prediction interval width

The `interval.width` function calculates two prediction interval widths: W50 and W95. The W50 contains 50 % of the previsions (Q75-Q25) and the W95 contains 95 % of the previsions (Q97.5-Q2.5). Since the interval width is only calculated on the Bayesian model previsions, it is possible to calculate them on actual and virtual mixtures. Similarly to `CRPS`, it is possible to specify the path to the file containing the Bayesian model previsions, rather than loading them into the workspace with `path.to.prev` (previously saved by `BMM.summary`).

The function returns and, if `save.path` is set, saves two data frames at the `save.dir` direction or if `save = TRUE` is set, saves them at the direction indicated by `path.to.prev`:

* `$samples` - ’Interval_width[_note].csv’: contains both interval width values for each source group for each virtual mixtures.

* `$mean` - ’Interval_width_mean[_note].csv’: contains the mean of both interval width values per contribution source class group for each virtual mixtures.

```{r}
# Calculate prediction interval width (W95, W50)
BMM.predWidth <- fingR::interval.width(path.to.prev = paste0(dir.mod.BMM, "BMM_prevision_VM.csv"), # Directory to Monte-Carlo simulation prevision CSV file (usually from fingR::JAGS.summary)
                                       mean.cal = TRUE,                                            # Calculate the group mean interval width (default FALSE)
                                       save = FALSE,                                               # To save results at the same location as path.to.prev (default FALSE)
                                       save.dir = dir.mod.BMM,                                     # Optional - Directory path to save results
                                       # note = "exemple"                                          # Optional - Additional file name annotation
                                       )
```
```{r}
BMM.predWidth$samples[1:6,]
```

```{r}
BMM.predWidth$mean
```


### 3.3.4 - Encompassed sample predictions

The `ESP` function calculates the Encompassed Sample Prediction (ESP). The ESP is a newly introduced statistics in [Chalaux-Clergue et al. (2024d)](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969724046941) and was created to assess the transferability of the statistics calculated on virtual mixtures to actual sediment samples. The ESP was calculated as the percentage of actual samples for which the predicted contributions remained within the lowest and the highest predicted contributions obtained for the virtual mixtures. When expressed as a percentage, ESP ranges from 0 to 100 %, the latter providing an optimal value. Values close to 100 % indicate a higher transferability of modelling evaluation statistics calculated on virtual mixture to actual sediment samples.

```{r}
sources.lvl <- c("Forest", "Subsoil", "Undecontaminated")

# Calculate encompassed sample predictions (ESP)
BMM.ESP <- fingR::ESP(obs = BMM.preds.VM,                       # data.frame with virtual mixtures predicted contributions
                      pred = BMM.preds.mixE,                    # Actual sediment samples predicted contributions
                      sources = paste0("Median_", sources.lvl), # Sources labels in prediction objects
                      # sources.obs = "",                       # Optional - character indicating sample id in obs data.frame
                      # sources.pred = "",                      # Optional - character indicating sample id in pred data.frame
                      count = "Both"                            # Count 'Number' and 'Percentage'
                      )
```
```{r}
BMM.ESP
```



# Future updates

The upcoming version will introduce the Python version of fingR, making the sediment source fingerprinting tools available to a broader community.

*Graphical support functions such as Bayesian prediction density plots, prediction vs. observation plots, and ternary diagrams are under development.*
